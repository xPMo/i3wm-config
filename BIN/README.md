#BIN: Associated Scripts:

###i3exit

A helper script to provide easy access to logind (loginctl or systemctl).  Originally from Manjaro's i3 Community Edition, changed the lock script to my own and added `hybrid-sleep` support.

###i3focuslaunch

A script to focus a program's window.  If it fails, it will then launch the program.

###i3hint

A script to provide context information to the user:  Most usefully, the current layout (splitv/splith/tabbed/stacked) and workspace.

Also has an option which I use to provide help for `$gaps_mode` in my i3 config.

###i3run

A helper script in order to launch something in an i3 session from without, for example from a tty or a cronjob.

###i3slopsize

Shamelessly stolen from Airblader, allows resizing a window via drawing a rectangle with slop.


###i3switchlaunch

This script is only used for the terminal workspace.  The approximate form is as follows:

```
if $workspace is focused:
    launch $program
else:
    focus workspace
    if $program is not focused:
        launch $program
```

###i3volumectl

Calling this script without any arguments toggles mute.  Otherwise, the argument is used to change the default sink's volume.


###imgur

This is a heavily modified fork of the well-known `imgur.sh` modified to make use of `dunstify` to control what actions to take on the urls.  I use this in conjunction with my `maim-dunst` script for full notification-based control.

It also has a `-e` option which prints out statements to be `eval`'d by bash for use in other scripts.

###ix-dunst

A fork of `ix` which uses `dunstify` actions for control.


###maim-dunst

A wrapper script for maim which uses `dunstify` to take actions on the resulting screenshot.  These actions are supported:

* Viewing the file via `$XIVIEWER` or `xdg-open`
* Editing the file with GIMP
* Uploading the file to Imgur
* Copying the screenshot to the clipboard with `xclip`
* Moving the screenshot to `$SCREENSHOT_DIR`
* Deleting the image

###passmenu

A fork of the default `passmenu` using Rofi instead of dmenu.


###popup-term

###scrotlock

A basic i3lock wrapper.  Takes a screenshot and pixelizes and slightly desaturates it before locking.

###sloprecord-dunst

A wrapper script for `ffmpeg` and `parecord` which uses `dunstify` to take actions on the recording.  It uses a lock in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` to prevent multiple recordings at once.  Calling it a second time is the standard way of stopping the recording.

These actions are supported:

* Viewing the file with `$XVVIEWER` or `xdg-open`
* Editing the file with Kdenlive or Audacity
* Copying the recording to `$RECORD_DIR`
* Deleting the file
* Uploading the file to TODO

###toggletrackpad

An old script for toggling the trackpad using `synclient`.  I haven't looked at the documentation for `libinput` for porting it.
