My i3wm config files.  Make of it what you will. (Also, trying to learn
more about Github workflow.)

**TODO:**
* Give up and make do with what I have.

By default, bindings for:
* [playerctl](https://github.com/acrisci/playerctl)
* pactl
* amixer
* xfce4-launcher
* Thunar
* [xflux](https://justgetflux.com/linux.html)
* Firefox
