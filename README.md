# i3wm-config
My i3, i3blocks, and accompanying config files.
The work of one year of constant tweaking,
two years of occasional tweaking,
one month of merging stuff from Manjaro-i3-CE,
and one more year of occasional tweaking.
Run `sh init.sh` to add symlinks in `~/.config/` and `~/.local/bin/`.

Default bindings which have been changed:
| Binding | i3's default | Mine |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Move between windows | `$mod+[jkl;]` | `$mod+hjkl` (as in Vi) |
| Resize windows | `jkl;` | `hjkl` (as in Vi) |
| Reload i3 configuration | `$mod+Shift+c` | `$mod+F2` |
| Restart i3 in-place | `$mod+Shift+r` | `$mod+Shift+F2` |
| Focus Child container | `$mod+d` (commented out because of dmenu) | `$mod+z` (to complement `$mod+a`) |
| Focus/move window to Scratchpad | `$mod+minus` `$mod+Shift+minus` | `$mod+c` `$mod+Shift+c` |
| Launch dmenu | `$mod+d` | `$mod+x,d` (`$mod+x` changes modes) |
| Split horizontal/vertical | `$mod+h` `$mod+v` | *unset* |
| Split toggle | *unset* | `$mod+n` |
| Exit i3 with `i3-nagbar` | `$mod+Shift+e` | `$mod+Shift+F3` |

i3wm features:
* No titlebars
* `$mod+x` for a focus/launch mode. (Press `<key>` to attempt to focus the associated program.  It will launch if it fails. Press `Shift+<key>` to launch a new instance, without regard to running instances.)
* `scrotlock` script which pixelizes and 50% desaturates
* `$mod+Return` focuses the terminal workspace and launches one if not already launched; if workspace was already focused, launches new terminal. `$mod+Shift+t` for new terminal anywhere
* `$mod+Tab` backandforth, let go of `$mod` to stay on the other workspace, or let go of `Tab` to return
* Certain programs will launch on certain workspaces
* Volume displayed in hexadecimal because why not
* Special bindings that I use with my Steam Controller
* Click events for most blocks
* Keyboard shortcuts to get notifications with system information
* Uses dunstify for `--replace`ing notifications
* Layout notification on layout change
* Uses `Xresources` to set gaps, colors, and (coming) more!

**i3blocks scripts:**
* CPU: right click to get `mpstat` notification
* Playerctl: click to playpause, right click for notification with album art and info
* Disks: click to open mount location, right click for `df` notification
* Temperature: right click for detailed temperature information
* Volume: scroll to change volume, right click to toggle mute

**Associated scripts:** *(See ./BIN/README.md)*

**TODO:**
* Set `S_COLORS` for mpstat colou?ri\[zs\]ation
* Branch with Barless config: workspace notification on workspace change, workspace Rofi
* Give up.
