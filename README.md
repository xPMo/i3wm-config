# i3wm-config
My i3wm config files.  Make of it what you will. (Also, trying to learn
more about Github workflow.)

This config has a 2-binds file in it which holds variables for $mod,
$mod2, $monitor and $monitor2. $mod is used for most window operations
and workspace control on the primary monitor. $mod2 is used for
workspace control on the secondary monitor. $monitor is the primary
monitor and $monitor2 is the secondary monitor. In the future, I hope to
write a script that generates this file and allows the user to easily
set right/left orientation for the monitors.

Bindings for:
* [playerctl](https://github.com/acrisci/playerctl)
